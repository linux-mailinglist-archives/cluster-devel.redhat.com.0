No but we can measure how vulnerable our current coding habits are to
the mistake this warning would potentially prevent.  I don't think it's
wrong to extrapolate that if we had no instances at all of prior coding
problems we likely wouldn't have any in future either making adopting
the changes needed to enable the warning valueless ... that's the zero
value case I was referring to above.

Now, what we have seems to be about 6 cases (at least what's been shown
in this thread) where a missing break would cause potentially user
visible issues.  That means the value of this isn't zero, but it's not
a no-brainer massive win either.  That's why I think asking what we've
invested vs the return isn't a useless exercise.

You mean we've already spent 90% of the effort to come this far so we
might as well go the remaining 10% because then at least we get some
return? It's certainly a clinching argument in defence procurement ...

I got my six patches by analyzing the lwn.net report of the fixes that
was cited which had 21 of which 50% didn't actually change the emitted
code, and 25% didn't have a user visible effect.

But the broader point I'm making is just because the compiler people
come up with a shiny new warning doesn't necessarily mean the problem
it's detecting is one that causes us actual problems in the code base. 
I'd really be happier if we had a theory about what classes of CVE or
bug we could eliminate before we embrace the next new warning.
