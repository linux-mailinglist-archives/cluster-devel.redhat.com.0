If the ClusterLabs projects switch together I might take the opportunity 
to make the switch in gfs2-utils.git at the same time, for consistency.

"main" works for me, it seems to be the most widely adopted alternative 
thanks to Github, so its purpose will be clear by convention. That said, 
it doesn't matter too much as long as the remote HEAD is set to the new 
branch.

Another question is how to do the switch without causing confusion the 
next time someone pulls. It might be safest to simply create the main 
branch and delete the master branch (rather than, say, replacing all of 
the content in master with an explanatory note). That way a 'git pull' 
gives a hint of the change and no messy conflicts:

   $ git pull
   From /tmp/gittest/upstream
    * [new branch]      main       -> origin/main
   Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/master'
   from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.

Maybe also push a 'master_is_now_main' tag annotated with 'use git 
branch -u origin/main to fix tracking branches'. Or maybe that's 
excessive :)

Cheers,
Andy
